## Summary: 
This express application takes the users burger input, stores it in a database gives the users the option to eat or "devour" the burger. Dependent on the users choice, the database and webpage reloads displaying their choice. 

### Screen 1: Add your burger

* User is able to add their burger choice, which is added to a working mysql database.

<br>

### Screen 2: Added burger Left screen

* Once the user's added a burger (clicked the submit button with their burger of choice), their burger is moved to the left side of the screen.

* The user is then prompted to see whether they've like to eat the burger.

<br>

### Screen 3: Devoured Right screen

* By clicking "devour it" the user chooses to eat the burger.

* The burger content is now moved to the right side of the screen and data is updated in mySQL.

### Notes
* This was challenging for me, but fun to get the app working!
